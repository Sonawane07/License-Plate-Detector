License Plate Detector
Overview
The License Plate Detector is an advanced image processing system designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images. By leveraging cutting-edge libraries and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques, the system achieves a remarkable 95% accuracy in recognizing license plates and converting them into text.

Features
License Plate Detection: Accurately locates license plates within images.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converts license plate images into readable text using PyTesseract.
High Accuracy: Achieves a 95% recognition accuracy through fine-tuned algorithms.
Data Export: Saves the detected license plate information with timestamps to a CSV file for easy retrieval.
Technologies Used
The system utilizes the following libraries:

OpenCV: For image processing and contour detection.
NumPy: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
PyTesseract: For OCR-based text recognition.
Imutils: For image manipulation and rotation.
Pandas: For data storage and manipulation.
Time: For timestamping data entries.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python pytesseract imutils pandas
Tesseract OCR installed on your system. Download it from Tesseract's official page.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-detector.git
cd license-plate-detector
Ensure dependencies are installed.
Prepare the input image: Place the vehicle image in the specified directory (e.g., dataset).
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python imageprocessing.py
View the Results:
The detected license plate text will be displayed in the terminal.
Processed images such as grayscale, edged, and cropped license plates will be saved locally.
Detected license plate data will be appended to a data.csv file.
Workflow
Image Preprocessing:
Image resizing and rotation.
Grayscale and bilateral filtering for noise reduction.
License Plate Localization:
Edge detection and contour approximation to isolate the license plate.
Character Segmentation and Recognition:
OCR applied to extract and convert license plate characters into text.
Data Storage:
License plate details and timestamps are stored in a CSV file for record-keeping.
